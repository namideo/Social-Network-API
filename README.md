The purpose of this assignment is to develop a social networking API that allows a user to creat comments and respond to other comments, as well as addng other users to their friends list. This application will be implementing MongoDB and utilizing Express.js and Insomnia. 

## Criteria
* When I run "npm start" in the command line the application runs and is connected to the Mongo Database.

* When I go into Insomnia I am connected to the server and am able to do GET requests for all Users and Thoughts. I can also pull individual Users and Thoughts by their id. 

* When I test my POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia, I am able to create, update, and remove Users and Thoughts. 

* I am also able to add or remove other users from a user's friend list using POST and DELETE. 

* I am also able to add or remove Reactions from my Thoughts using POST and DELETE.
